# Diabetes Prediction
## Phase 2
## Normal Task
This repository contains the code and dataset for a data analysis project aimed at predicting diabetes occurrence using machine learning techniques. During my internship at Coders Cave, I had the opportunity to utilize machine learning techniques, to estimate the chances of diabetes. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of diabetes based on various health-related features.
### Project Structure
* `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv`.csv is the dataset used for the Diabetes Prediction. It is extracted from the kaggle.com
* `Diabetes Prediction.ipynb` is the Jupyter notebook that includes the Python script that automates certain tasks, such as data exploration, model development, and model deployment.
### Dependencies
The code in this repository relies on the following libraries:
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
  
Ensure that these dependencies are installed in your Python environment before running the code.
### Contributions
If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to submit an issue or a pull request. Contributions and feedback from the community are highly appreciated and will help enhance the project.
