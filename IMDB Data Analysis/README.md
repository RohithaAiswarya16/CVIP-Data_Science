# IMDb Data Analysis
### Phase 1
### Normal Task
This repository contains the code and dataset for my IMDb data analysis project. During my internship at Coders Cave, I had the opportunity to dive into the fascinating world of IMDb and conduct a comprehensive analysis of an extensive movie database. This project aimed to extract valuable insights, identify trends, and uncover patterns within the data.
### Project Structure
* imdb_top_1000.csv is the IMDB dataset used for the analysis. It is extracted from the kaggle.com
* IMDB Data Analysis.ipynb is the jupyter notebook that includes the python script that automate certain tasks, such as data preprocessing, cleaning, and transforming.
### Dependencies
The code in this repository relies on the following libraries:
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* WordCloud
  
Ensure that these dependencies are installed in your Python environment before running the code.
