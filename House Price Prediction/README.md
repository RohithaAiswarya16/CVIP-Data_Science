# House Price Prediction
### Phase 1
### Golden task
This repository contains the code and dataset for my House Price Prediction project. During my internship at Coders Cave, I had the opportunity to utilize machine learning techniques, to estimate the prices of residential properties. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable model that can assist in predicting house prices based on various features.
### Project Structure
* house_price_prediction.csv is the IMDB dataset used for the analysis. It is extracted from the kaggle.com
* House Price Prediction.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook that includes the Python script that automates certain tasks, such as data preprocessing, cleaning, and transforming.
### Dependencies
The code in this repository relies on the following libraries:
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
  
Ensure that these dependencies are installed in your Python environment before running the code.
